10114,CVE-1999-0524,0,None,192.168.11.139,icmp,0,ICMP Timestamp Request Remote Date Disclosure,It is possible to determine the exact time set on the remote host.,"The remote host answers to an ICMP timestamp request.  This allows an
attacker to know the date that is set on the targeted machine, which
may assist an unauthenticated, remote attacker in defeating time-based
authentication protocols.

Timestamps returned from machines running Windows Vista / 7 / 2008 /
2008 R2 are deliberately incorrect, but usually within 1000 seconds of
the actual system time.","Filter out the ICMP timestamp requests (13), and the outgoing ICMP
timestamp replies (14).",,"This host returns non-standard timestamps (high bit is set)

unresponsive.

There are several possible reasons for this :

  - The scan may have caused a service to freeze or stop
    running.

  - An administrator may have stopped a particular service
    during the scanning process.

This might be an availability problem related to the following :

  - A network outage has been experienced during the scan,
    and the remote network cannot be reached anymore by the
    scanner.

  - This scanner may has been blacklisted by the system
    administrator or by an automatic intrusion detection /
    prevention system that detected the scan.

  - The remote host is now down, either because a user
    turned it off during the scan or because a select denial
    of service was effective.

need to be done again.",#NAME?,,"Port 554 was detected as being open but is now closed

Service) is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack. The RDP 
client makes no effort to validate the identity of the server when 
setting up encryption. An attacker with the ability to intercept 
traffic from the RDP server can establish encryption with the client 
and server without being detected. A MiTM attack of this nature would 
allow the attacker to obtain any sensitive information transmitted, 
including authentication credentials.

This flaw exists because the RDP server stores a hard-coded RSA
private key in the mstlsapi.dll library. Any local user with
access to this file (on any Windows system) can retrieve the
key and use it for this attack.","- Force the use of SSL as a transport layer for this service if

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and

  - Multiple remote code execution vulnerabilities exist in
    Microsoft Server Message Block 1.0 (SMBv1) due to
    improper handling of certain requests. An
    unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit these
    vulnerabilities, via a specially crafted packet, to

ETERNALBLUE, ETERNALCHAMPION, ETERNALROMANCE, and ETERNALSYNERGY are
four of multiple Equation Group vulnerabilities and exploits disclosed
on 2017/04/14 by a group known as the Shadow Brokers. WannaCry /
WannaCrypt is a ransomware program utilizing the ETERNALBLUE exploit,
and EternalRocks is a worm that utilizes seven Equation Group
vulnerabilities. Petya is a ransomware program that first utilizes
CVE-2017-0199, a vulnerability in Microsoft Office, and then spreads
via ETERNALBLUE.","Microsoft has released a set of patches for Windows Vista, 2008, 7,
2008 R2, 2012, 8.1, RT 8.1, 2012 R2, 10, and 2016. Microsoft has also
released emergency patches for Windows operating systems that are no
longer supported, including Windows XP, 2003, and 8.

For unsupported Windows operating systems, e.g. Windows XP, Microsoft
recommends that users discontinue the use of SMBv1. SMBv1 lacks
security features that were included in later SMB versions. SMBv1 can
be disabled by following the vendor instructions provided in Microsoft
KB2696547. Additionally, US-CERT recommends that users block SMB
directly by blocking TCP port 445 on all network boundary devices. For
SMB over the NetBIOS API, block TCP ports 137 / 139 and UDP ports 137
/ 138 on all network boundary devices.","http://www.nessus.org/u?68fc8eff

  - Multiple information disclosure vulnerabilities exist
    in Microsoft Server Message Block 1.0 (SMBv1) due to
    improper handling of SMBv1 packets. An unauthenticated,
    remote attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities, via a
    specially crafted SMBv1 packet, to disclose sensitive
